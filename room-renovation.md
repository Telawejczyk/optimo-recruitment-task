# Room renovation
**1.	Room description**

Room is at the second floor of the house. Shape of it is trapeze with roof windows, two wardrobes, one bed, one long(2.5 m) desk, few posters on walls and a keyboard. Dimensions of it are like on the photo below:

**2. Preparation**

For preparation it is need to buy all the stuff that will be necessary during the renovation. First of all it will by LEDs, second is filament for 3D printer. With these two things it will be possible to make hidden gaming room. Hidden due to that the room will be cut in half be a new wall in to rectangle and a smaller one trapeze with a whole gaming set up. To do that it will also be need of some wooden planks to make shelves for fantasy books. It will also be a “secret” door.
For building a wall - buy plaster board, gypsum mortar, brackets, bolts, planks, plexi glass
For painting - buy some blue, white, black and pink paint and brown varnish for wood

**3.	First step**

First of all take everything out from the room including furniture(unscrew it) and bulbs with their frames. Just not to destroy anything. 

**4.	Painter's tape**

Tape is required to avoid painting over the door frame or window frame.

**5.	Bookshelf**

Prepare bookshelf from planks, brackets and bolts. It should have like 180 cm height and 80 cm width. Paint it with brown varnish for wood. Add white LEDs on every single shelf.

**6.	Wall**

First divide room and measure space for wall and it’s skeleton. Then mount planks in to the skeleton around the walls, floor, ceiling and few planks that are from top to bottom. Also here make space for entrance that will be made from by bookshelf.

**7.	Entrance**

Bookshelf should be easy to open so to move whole bookshelf with a lot of books and maybe some 3D printed figures it will be need to use some mechanics. For example rails. On them bookshelf could slide backwards in to the gaming room. Here might cool to use one of the books to open that mechanism. For example – slightly pulling the book will activate the mechanism and allows the bookcase to be moved back by a hand on rails.

**8.	Painting**

After finishing the wall it is need to paint all the walls. White for bedroom and other colors for the gaming room. Paint mechanism from bookshelf in to black(rails).

**9.	Furniture assembling**

Take of all the tape, Take old furniture and screw all parts together like it was before including new shelves for games and 3D printed figures in the gaming room. Put back all the bulbs with frames.

**10.	LED**

LED strips should go around the desk and on the wall to the ceiling and also there. After gluing them all around, put cotton wool on wall and ceiling to make the light shine in a cool way.
Put LED strip around the gaming room in the top corner and 3D print or buy or use cotton wool to hide strip and make light shine around.

**11.	LED clock shelf**

3D print parts of the shelf that is in the same time a clock. Dimensions are about more then 1 meter long and 50 centimeters height. It is basically an electric clock with illuminated vertical and horizontal shelves to show the time. Plug LEDs to the socket using charger cube from the phone but first use Arduino or ESP to make clock works by uploading proper code.

**12.	Figures**

3D print or buy some figures from the assassin’s creed series, the Wither series, Star Wars series and Skyrim to put them on LED clock shelves. Also put books and board games in to bookshelf. 
After putting stuff on LED clock shelf close it with plexi glass.

**13.	Desk stuff**

Put back on the desk all the stuff that was there(PC, monitor, cables and so on). Plug everything in and add to whole cable system the ones from LEDs. Put back stuff to the wardrobe.

**14.	3D Printer home**

Buy two small tables from IKEA. They should be 55 by 55 cm. Screw them as in instruction. 3D print parts that are need to assembly them like one on top of the other.  Screw them to the base from wood. Screw element to mount LEDs from the bottom of the upper table. Add plexi glass walls and 3D printed parts to mount it. Use plexi glass with proper printed elements to make doors in top and bottom. Make a hole for cable from 3D printer and LEDs cable. Mount LEDs. Put stuff from the printer in the bottom space of prepared rack and printer above. Close the doors. Put in the gaming room corner.
